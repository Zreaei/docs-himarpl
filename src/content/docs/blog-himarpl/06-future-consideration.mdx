Let's talk about some things that future HIMARPL cabinets should think about when working on improving the Blog HIMARPL website.

## What We've Noticed
- Right now, HIMARPL staff aren't really using the website much. This isn't really the kominfo team's fault (we just build the website!) - it's more about getting people aware and excited about using it. The next cabinet should focus on getting more people involved.

- The code could definitely use some cleanup. We had to build this pretty quickly to meet deadlines, so things got a bit messy. Future teams might want to clean up and reorganize the code to make it easier to work with and expand.

## Some Ideas to Consider

- Try using PostHog to see how people are actually using the website - this can help figure out what's working and what needs improvement.

- Take some time to clean up the code, especially in the Editor component library. This will make it much easier for future teams to add new features!
