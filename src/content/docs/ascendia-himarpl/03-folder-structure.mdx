This project follows the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) architecture, which emphasizes type-safety and modularity. The structure above shows our feature-based organization, clear separation of client/server code, and adherence to Next.js App Router conventions.

Key features of this structure:
- Feature-based component organization
- Type-safe API layer with tRPC
- Database management with Prisma
- Environment variable validation
- Modular and scalable architecture
