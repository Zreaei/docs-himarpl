description: Looking ahead - what's next for the HIMARPL website?
---

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Let's talk about some important things to keep in mind for future HIMARPL cabinets when they're building their own version of the organization's website.

## What We Learned

- **We Need a Designer!** Right now, our website was built without a UI/UX designer, which means it could look and feel a lot better. Future cabinets should try to get a designer on board in the Kominfo Department to make the site more user-friendly and visually awesome.

- **The Animation Dilemma** We've noticed something interesting - while animations make the site more interactive and fun, they also slow things down and aren't great for SEO. Future teams might want to:
  - Remove some animations
  - Try a different tech stack
  - Find a better balance between cool effects and performance

## Tips for Future Teams

- **Keep What Works:** Feel free to stick with our basic website structure - home page, about page, dedication page, etc. It's a solid foundation!

- **Make It Your Own:** While the current layout is good, don't be afraid to try different tools or technologies that might work better for you. Innovation is always welcome! 

- **Don't Forget the Footer:** One must-have is the global footer component - it helps users navigate between all the HIMARPL website pages easily. Think of it as the glue that holds everything together! ðŸ”—
