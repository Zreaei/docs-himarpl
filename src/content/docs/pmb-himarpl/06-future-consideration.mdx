description: Looking ahead - what's next for the PMB HIMARPL website?

Let's talk about some things that future PMB HIMARPL cabinets should think about when working on improving the PMB HIMARPL website.

## What We Learned

- Coordination with the Advokastra department is crucial. The current website is built without coordination with the Advokastra department, which means it could look and feel a lot better. Future cabinets should try to get a designer on board in the Advokastra Department to make the site more user-friendly and visually awesome.
- Manualy adding content to MDX in the github assets-himarpl repository is a bit of a pain, this didn't integrate with the blog because it is made before the blog was created.

## Some Ideas to Consider

- In the next cabinet, try to change the most important information on the website, like the registration information, to make it more relevant to the current year. Also, the contact information should be updated to the current Advokastra members.
- Try to force Advokastra Staffs to make an article news in the [blog.himarpl.com](https://blog.himarpl.com) and tag the article news with `berita pmb`, `snbt`, `snbp`, `pmb`, `prestasi istimewa`, `sm upi`. This will help the website to get more traffic from search engines, especially for `pmb himarpl` related keywords.
- Try to make the website more user-friendly, like adding a search bar to the website, or adding a feature to the website to make it easier to find the information you need.
- Migrate and integrate all of the new content from MDX in the github assets-himarpl repository to the blog himarpl with a certain tag or label (etc. snbp, snbt, pmb, prestasi istimewa, sm upi), this will make the website more up to date and easier to manage.
