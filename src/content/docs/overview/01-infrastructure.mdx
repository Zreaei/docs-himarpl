## Database Solutions

Our projects use various database solutions:

- **ORM**: Prisma

## Analytics & Monitoring

We implement various tools to monitor our applications:

- **Error Tracking**: Sentry
- **Usage Analytics**: Umami (self-hosted)

## Rate Limiting

To protect our services, we implement rate limiting:
