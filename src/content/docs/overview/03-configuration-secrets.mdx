Proper management of configuration and secrets is crucial for security and maintainability. Each project has its own setup and environment variables that you can follow the steps in each of the project's contributing guide or this documentation page.

## Environment Variables

**Important Note for Kominfo Staff**

All environment variables are stored in [main HIMARPL Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
It is in the `/KABINET ASCENDIA 2024/BADAN EKSEKUTIF/DEPT. KOMINFO/Data/Environment Variables` folder.
:::

For each project, there is a `.env.example` file. You can use this as a template to create the `.env` file for your local environment.
